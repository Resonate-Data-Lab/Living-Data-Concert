          <h3>Sharon Alker</h3>
          <p>“The whole concert transformed the meaning of music for me. Usually, I am transported by the beauty of music at a concert and there is no overt meaning beyond that beauty. Here, I was not only able to participate in the music, but was able to understand the evolution of the patterns in the data-immersed music. It gave me a new way to think about music, and a new way to understand data.
”</p>
          <h3>William Bares</h3>
                <p>I really enjoyed how ROYGBIV demonstrated how colors can map to sound first beginning with a children's musical scale toy (xylophone) and next to tubes of noble gases to demonstrate how each element had a distinctive spectra (?) and sound. ROYGBIV'S explanations made it much easier and enjoyable to appreciate the more complex sounds that came from mixing or sequencing the individual chemical elements.

          <h3>Walker Smith</h3>
          <p>“I loved playing in the tree sonification piece together. It was so fun to work together and come up with something that combined our different interests and instrumental/narrative skills. Also, as someone very newly acquainted to the trees and landscape at Whitman, I enjoyed the narrative descriptions of the tress. I had gone on a walk and I’m sure I saw a few of the trees, but most of them were left to my imagination to conjure up. I was really inspired seeing everyone’s very different approaches to sonification, and to explaining the process behind sonification. I liked Aura’s way of showcasing the “behind-the-scenes” parts of the sonification design process, and I also appreciated Jordan’s guided participatory experiences with the audience. In contrast, I felt that Tristan didn’t show much of the behind the scenes, but he gave short and very effective explanation of the sonification pieces and then allowed them to speak for themselves. I think all of these approaches worked well, and it opened my eyes to the different ways that I can bring the audience into the design or compositional process (and when I would want to do that, vs. when I would want to just show the final product).
