<p>Living Data: Hear Your Life Differently
Description 
Join us for Living Data: A Sonification Concert. This live, participatory event is equal parts science, story, and sound. 
Real data becomes live music, poems turn into textures, and you’ll listen to the world in a totally new way.
With performances by Walker Smith, Auralee Walmer, Tristan Peng, and Jordan Wirfs-Brock, as well as opportunities for audience participation, this is not your usual concert.
